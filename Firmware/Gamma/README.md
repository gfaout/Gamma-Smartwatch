This file is to lay out the general organization and initial testing of the Gamma Smartwatch firmware.

As of now, preliminary testing has been done on LCD displays, and i2c.  

Once parts are assembled (this will be done in the future), the full software testing and development will be completed.  

This is anticipated for Winter of 2022 and Spring of 2022 at the earliest.
